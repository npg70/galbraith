$p{Extensive notes on $child-link[galbraith-john-1809-mcewing]{John Galbraith}, founder of Scotia Distillery and Provost of Campbeltown 1860-66:}

$blockquote{
His Galbraith family was not of native Kintyre stock, but descended from 17th century Lowland settlers. John's parents were Archibald Galbraith, merchant, and Jean Corbet. His grandfather, Archibald Galbraith, was a merchant in Campbeltown, and his great-grandfather, William, was a maltster. Each of these, like his father, married into a Plantation family: Langwill and Dunlop, respectively. John's bother William, a merchant in Campbeltown, was a partner in Stewart, Galbraith & co. from its foundation until his death in 1883. His other brothers, Archibald and Andrew, who left Kintyre, were cotton-spinners amd merchants, and Andrew was Lord Provost of Glasgow from 1857 until 1860.
}
$blockquote{
His widow, Mary Coville McEwing, was aged 82 when she died in 1900. Her parents were John Townley McEwing, R.N., and Elizabeth Colville. For daughter Elizabeth...
}

$p{The reference of parent and grandparents both being "Archibald Galbraith" is incorrect. His father $child-link[galbreath-archibald-1760-langwill-corbet]{Archibald Galbreath} married twice, first to Martha Langwill, then Jean Corbet.
This makes $child-link[galbreath-william-1736-dunlop]{William Galbreath} the grand-father, not great-grandfather.
}
$p{
There is an error with the death of the brother William Galbreath. He died in 1863 not 1883.
