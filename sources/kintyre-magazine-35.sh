Letters to America, by A I B Stewart

$blockquote{
$child-link[galbreath-james-1659-nielson]{James Galbreath} and his
wife Mary Nielsone were apparenly first in Ardnacross,
when their son John was baptised on 22 August 1672
and thereafter in Kilkeddan when the following sons were baptised:
Patrick, 28 October 1674; Archibald, 17 July 1678; John, 30 May 1680;
and David, 1682. At this point between 1 January 1684 and 18th June 1686
there is a gap in the register but thereafter Mathew appears
on 15th March 1691.
}

Confirmed, with the exception of "David, 1682." for whom there is no baptism record in the OPR.  Other reports give a birth of 1684 and a death of 1754, but also without sources.

$blockquote{
$child-link[galbreath-john-1680-mitchell]{John} married Mary Mitchell
and they had apparently thirteen children between 1708 and 1726
among whom was $child-link[galbreath-john-1721-langwill]{John} born on 9th December 1721 who married Agnes Langwill.
}

My count is 12, with the last one Samuel, baptized  8 Aug 1725.

$blockquote{
On Mary Mitchell's death John senior married Katherine McCallum who gave him one son, Archibald.
}

Almost.  No evidence of marriage, however an Archibald Galbreath and Katherine McCallum are recorded as the parents of "natural birth" (i.e. illegitimate) of Archibald Galbreath.

$blockquote{
There is something of a mystery about Agnes Langwill. The Lowland church register gives her name as Agnes four times but in one of the letters hereinafter produced she signs herself Janet Langwill. This discrepancy was noticed as long ago as 1895 when the late Mr Archibald Dunlop Armour was in touch with the family. Like him, I can provide no explanation.
}

I do recall seeing one letter signed Janet as "step-mother."

$blockquote{
Among the four children of John Galbreath and Agnes Langwill
was $child-link[galbreath-alexander-1753-flemming]{Alexander},
baptised on 25th June 1753, who, on 28 December 1779 married Agnes, daughter of Daniel Fleming, a Campbeltown merchant, and Isobel Johnstone.
}

Confirmed.

$blockquote{
Alexander with his family emigrated and landed in Baltimore on 1st September 1785 where he carried on his trade of master tailor. On 7th August 1787 he got a grant of land in Harford County, Maryland, just south of the Mason-Dixon line, which he named Galbreath's Delight. In 1796 he acquired more land from the heirs of William Penn. This land was in York County, Pennsylvania, just north of the Mason-Dixon line and five miles west of the Susquehanna River. This large farm of several hundred acres remained in the family until 1939. The house he built in 1819 just before his death is illustrated on the front cover.

$blockquote{
When in 1992 I went to York County in search of information about Hugh Henry Breckenridge whose family had settled in the same district only some thirty years before the Galbreaths I was most courteously conducted through the district by Joe Galbreath, sixth in line from the emigrant Alexander. While there was no memory of the Breckenridges I feel sure the settlement of two families from within five miles of Campbeltown in the same area within thirty years is more than a coincidence. This Galbreath family has been more assiduous than any I know in keeping up the family connection in the States. Periodical family reunions are celebrated and a family record which has reached the ninth generation from Alexander is carefully maintained.

TBD: Joe Galbreath

Nine generations were listed in "The Alexander Galbraith Family", published 1955,1976,1932.

$blockquote{
Most interesting of all is the fact that somehow a bundle of late 18th century letters from relatives at home has survived, One of these letters was published in Number 14 of the Magazine, (and repeated here- 21 july 1791), but in view of the very considerable amount of genealogical data which they contain and of the picture they give of life in Campbeltown two hundred years ago I have thought it worth while to publish them all.

$blockquote{
Perhaps the most distinguished member of the family who
remained in Kintyre was
$child-link[galbraith-john-1809-mcewing]{John Galbraith} (1809-1861[1881])
who was Provost of the Burgh from 1860 till 1866 and whose daughter
[ $child-link[galbraith-elizabeth-1841-fleming]{Elizabeth Galbraith} ]
married the ill-fated banker James Nicol Fleming (Magazine No. 28).
He too was descended like the emigrant [ $child-link[galbreath-alexander-1753-flemmin]{Alexander} ]
from $child-link[galbreath-john-1680-mitchell]{John} in Kilteddan
and Mary Mitchell, but through their oldest son
$child-link[galbreath-archibald-1708-white]{Archibald}.
}

It appears there is confusion over on the parents of John Galbraith (1809-1881) (and his brother $child-link[galbraith-andrew-1799-scott]{Andrew}, below)

This claims he is a descendant of John Galbreath and Mary Mitchell,
via their oldest son $child-link[galbreath-archibald-1708-white]{Archibald} who married Martha White. That can't be correct since their last chld were was born in 1758.

$blockquote{
Mr A.L. Mitchell, author of that article, informs me that John's 
older brother $child-link[galbraith-andrew-1799-scott]{Andrew} (1799-1888) was Lord Provost of Glasgow, from 1857-1860. He was also a founder member of the Kintyre Club and three times its president, including during the 50th anniversary year, 1875.
}

Confirmed.

$blockquote{
I am particularly indebted to the late Wm. W. Galbreath Jr of Lynchburg, Virginia, a nuclear scientist, for originally making the correspondence available to me and to Mr Ralph W. Sloan of Westminster, Maryland, the present archivist of' the American Galbreaths. I hope that local members will appreciate that the footnotes to the correspondence are much more detailed than they might find necessary. This is for the benefit of American readers who do not have the same local knowledge.
