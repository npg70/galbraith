His Galbraith family was not native Kintyre stock, but descended from 17th century Lowland settlers. John's parents were Archibald Galbreath, merchant, and Jean Corbet. His grandfather, Archibald Galbreath, was a merchant in Campbeltown, and his great-grandfather, William, was a maltster. Each of these, like his father, married into a Plantation family: Langwill and Dunlop, respectively
