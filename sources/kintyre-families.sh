NOTE: Maybe mention Scotia/Glen Scotia/Stewart, Galbraith & Co, distiller by name?
NOTE: Perhaps add correction to Campbeltown Whiskey here? There it was mentioned on page 77:
His Galbraith family was not native Kintyre stock, but descended from 17th century Lowland settlers. John's parents were Archibald Galbreath, merchant, and Jean Corbet. His grandfather, Archibald Galbreath, was a merchant in Campbeltown, and his great-grandfather, William, was a maltster. Each of these, like his father, married into a Plantation family: Langwill and Dunlop, respectively
The two "Archibald Galbreath" are the same person. He married twice, first to Margaret Langwill, then to Jean Corbet.
Using this correction, the grand-father is William Galbreath who married Margaret Dunlop

Possible Additions

John McLaren Galbraith, son of John McCorkindale Galbraith and Margaret Hardie Young, was born 21 April 1918. He died 14 May 1961. Mentioned in The Campbeltown Book as "probably the first Kintyre man to cross the Atlantic by air." but the full story is quite interesting (click in to see it)

William G- (bother), jeweller/watchmaker, d. 1915, age 81. Already mentioned, but the arson/theft/attempted murder story is good.

Archibald Alexander Galbraith, also nicknamed Sandy, and great-grandson of the other Archibald Sandy, and son of Alexander and Marion (McDougall) Galbraith. If I got this correct.

b. 1945, d. 25 Jan 2022. m. Doreen Allen in 1971

The modern shipyard at Trench Point ... built only two fishing boats for Campbeltown owners... The Aquarian was launched in spring [of 1971] for Archibald Galbraith.
Perhaps the same Archibald involved in the rescue of 10 people from the motor yacht Quesada on the night of 22nd/23rd May, 1966. https://lifeboatmagazinearchive.rnli.org/volume/40/419/award-for-scottish-skipper?searchterm=Yacht+Gan&page=691
Archibald Galbreath son of Donald Galbraith and Margaret McNeil, was born 24 Apr 1856 at Killean and Kilchenzie. He died 28 Apr 1936. He married 30 January 1885 at Killean and Kilchenzie to Margaret McCallum.

Margaret was mentioned in the Campbeltown Courier, Honouring Killean and Kilchenzie’s fallen 100 years on, Updated: 04/08/22, 4:31 pm. Her's sons Donald and Archibald were killed in WWI, in Bulgaria and France respectively.

Before family members laid their wreaths at the foot of the memorial in 1922, the first wreath was placed by Mrs Archibald Galbraith, two of whose sons were included in the fallen. This was followed by a march past of ex-servicemen.
