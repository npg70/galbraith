That's it for Sam!

The $child-link[galbreath-samuel-1736-mcnair]{Samuel Galbreath} married Janet McNair, although the record is missing or lost.  He was farmer in Peninver, so he's not the maltster / trader.

The remaining records, have 3 baptisms, and 3 weddings:

The $child-link[galbreath-samuel-1765-langwill]{Samuel Galbreath} that married Janet Langiwl in 1790 is mostly unknown.  They had seven children up to 1806.  There is a tombstone for Janet, but without any dates.   So while a mystery he is probably not the maltster we are looking for. (He might be his son however)>

The Sam that married Jane Fleeming is completely knownly except for the marriage record.  The $elink[https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/9M96-NPS]{Family Search} entry was untouched until i found it in 2025.

The same goes for Sam that married Jean Ryburn.  Nothing except the marriage record, and $elink[https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/9M96-NL1]{FamilySearch} untouched.
