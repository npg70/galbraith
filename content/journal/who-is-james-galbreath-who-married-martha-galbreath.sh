title: Who is James Galbreath who Marrried Martha Galbreath?


What we know:

$ul{
$li{Farmed Skerbolin his whole life}
$li{Married Martha Galbraith, who was living in nearby Peninver.}
$li{Had 11 children with Martha}
$li{Died around 1830 based on marriage records of daughters.}
}

What's unlikely:

$ul{
$li{
The parents of James is sometimes listed as being born 1768, the son of $child-link[galbreath-william-1736-dunlop]{William Galbreath} and Mary Dunlop. The date is right. However, this is unlikely as that family was listed as living in Campbeltown in 1792. After living in the city it's unlikely he'd move out to the farm.
}
}

What's Probable:

$ul{
$li{His parents were farmers in the Skerbolin, Peninver, Ugdale area, which would be in the Campbeltown parish.}
$li{Father's name is James, Archibald, Samuel, John.}
$li{Born 1750-1780}
}

What are the canidates:
$hr{}
$p{ 
James, b. 1750 $child-link[galbreath-james-1713-adam]{James Galbreath} m. Margaret Adam
}

A bit early. Unfortauntely not too many details on what James did, of where he was located.

$hr{}
$p{
James, b. 1753 $child-link[galbreath-david-1720-baird]{David Galbreath} m. Margaret Baird.
}

Possible, but a bit early, and almost nothing is known about this family.  No records found after the birth of children.

$hr{}
$p{
James, b. 1761, $child-link[galbreath-james-1726-anderson]{James Galbreath} m. Margaret Anderson
}

Similar problems to James x Margaret Adam.  No details on where they were located.

$hr{}
$p{
James, b. 1768, $child-link[galbreath-henry-1739-armour]{Henry Galbreath} m. Agnes Armour.
}
This $child-link[galbreath-james-1768-harvey]{James} married Jean Harvey and was a baker.

$hr{}
$p{
James, b. 1768, $child-link[galbreath-william-1736-dunlop]{William Galbreath} and Mary Dunlop
}

Unlikely since family was living in Campbeltown the city in 1792.  Unlikely James would leave and go into farming.
$hr{}
$p{James, b. 1773 $child-link[galbreath-orsla-1745-galbreath]{Orsla Galbraith} and Archibald Galbreath}

Another one where not much is known...

$hr{}
$p{
James, b. 1775 $child-link[galbraith-john-1741-clark]{John Galbraith} m. Katharine Clark
}

Possible, but like some of the other matches, there is no information on this family except the baptism of children.  Possible they died out, or moved out.

$hr{}
$p{
James, b. 1782 $child-link[galbreath-alexander-1753-flemming]{Alexander Galbreat} and Agnes Fleming.
}

This James died unmarried in the USA.
