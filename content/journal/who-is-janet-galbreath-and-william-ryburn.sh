title: Who is Janet Galbreath who married William Ryburn
---

$h2{We know some things!}

$ul{
$li{ $child-link[galbreath-janet-1741-ryburn]{Janet Galbreath} married William Ryburn in 1761}
$li{ They has at least 12 children over 26 years }
$li{ Three children were named Ann (implying at least two died young).}
$li{ There is a 6.5 year gap from 1778 to 1785 }
$li{ They are not in the Census of 1792 }
}

Human reproductive age according to the World Health Org, is 15-49, which puts her marriage age at a maximum of 22 or 23 depending on how you count.  Which gives a birth year no earlier than 1739.


Also there a Kilkerran Cemetary marker:

$blockquote{
978 1823 Erected by JAMES RYBURN, shipmaster in Campbeltown, to the memory of WILLIAM RYBURN his father who died 15 June 1819 aged 81 and JANET GALBRAITH his mother who died 17 August 1793 aged 52.
}

Assuming this is accurate, William b. 1738, and Janet, b. 1741, married at age 20, and the last child was born at age 47.  This fits our hypothesis.

Problem: there is no James.  Assuming accurate, he's born in the dead zone of 1778-1785.  Unfortunately nothing shows up in Statutory Records for Death, nor in the Census of 1841.

$h2{What the interweb says}

$child-link[galbreath-janet-1735]{Janet Galbreath}, bp. 1735

Unlikely. Last child would have been born at age 52.


James: born 1778-1785
Not found in Statutory Records for Death
