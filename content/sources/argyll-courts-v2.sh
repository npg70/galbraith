1. Petition: The Creditors of the deceased Archibald Harvie, merchant in Campbeltown
When Archibald Harvie died, he left his affairs in considerable disarray. This petition was an
attempt by a group of merchants in Campbeltown to ensure that the major creditors received
their fair share. John Langwill, Robert Maxwell, Robert Orr, Hugh Maxwell, Robert Fulton,
Daniel Ballantine, William Watson, William Harvie jun and sen, Andrew Harvie, Alexander
Johnston jun and Duncan Ballantine, all merchants, James Park, tailor, and James Harvie sen
and jun, tenants in Park, petitioned that the proceeds of the recent auction of Archibald
Harvie's shares in various vessels should be made available. The Vice-Admiral Substitute
granted the petition, as far as the money actually deposited with the Sheriff Clerk was
concerned, which came to â‚¬ 322 18s 5d. 28 Mar 1781.
