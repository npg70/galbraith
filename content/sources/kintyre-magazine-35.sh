$blockquote{
$child-link[galbreath-james-1659-nielson]{James Galbreath} and his
wife Mary Nielsone were apparenly first in Ardnacross,
when their son John was baptised on 22 August 1672
and thereafter in Kilkeddan when the following sons were baptised:
Patrick, 28 October 1674; Archibald, 17 July 1678; John, 30 May 1680;
and David, 1682. At this point between 1 January 1684 and 18th June 1686
there is a gap in the register but thereafter Mathew appears
on 15th March 1691.
}

Confirmed, with the exception of "David, 1682." for whom there is no baptism record in the OPR.  Other reports give a birth of 1684 and a death of 1754, but also without sources.

$blockquote{
$child-link[galbreath-john-1680-mitchell]{John} married Mary Mitchell
and they had apparently thirteen children between 1708 and 1726
among whom was $child-link[galbreath-john-1721-langwill]{John} born on 9th December 1721 who married Agnes Langwill.
}

My count is 12, with the last one Samuel, baptized  8 Aug 1725.

$blockquote{
On Mary Mitchell's death John senior married Katherine McCallum who gave him one son, Archibald.
}

Almost.  No evidence of marriage, however an John Galbreath and Katherine McCallum are recorded as the parents of "natural birth" (i.e. illegitimate) of Archibald Galbreath.

$blockquote{
There is something of a mystery about Agnes Langwill. The Lowland church register gives her name as Agnes four times but in one of the letters hereinafter produced she signs herself Janet Langwill. This discrepancy was noticed as long ago as 1895 when the late Mr $child-link[armour-archibald-dunlop-1863-stuart-smith]{Archibald Dunlop Armour} was in touch with the family. Like him, I can provide no explanation.
}
$p{
The correspondence with $child-link[armour-archibald-dunlop-1863-stuart-smith]{Archibald Dunlop Armour} has not been published. He was the Grandson of $child-link[armour-robert-1787-porter]{Robert Armour}, the illicit still maker in Campbeltown.  He was also the founder of the Campbeltown Picture House.
}
$p{
The mystery of Agnes Langwill versus Janet Langwill is more than just her name. She was also supposedly dead. More details below.
}
$blockquote{
Among the four children of John Galbreath and Agnes Langwill
was $child-link[galbreath-alexander-1753-flemming]{Alexander},
baptised on 25th June 1753, who, on 28 December 1779 married Agnes, daughter of Daniel Fleming, a Campbeltown merchant, and Isobel Johnstone.
}

$p{
Unclear who the spouse of Alexander was.  Certainly $child-link[fleeming-daniel-1721-johnstone]{Daniel Fleeming} had a daughter Agnes around this time.
}

$blockquote{
Alexander with his family emigrated and landed in Baltimore on 1st September 1785 where he carried on his trade of master tailor. On 7th August 1787 he got a grant of land in Harford County, Maryland, just south of the Mason-Dixon line, which he named Galbreath's Delight. In 1796 he acquired more land from the heirs of William Penn. This land was in York County, Pennsylvania, just north of the Mason-Dixon line and five miles west of the Susquehanna River. This large farm of several hundred acres remained in the family until 1939. The house he built in 1819 just before his death is illustrated on the front cover.
}

$blockquote{
When in 1992 I went to York County in search of information about Hugh Henry Breckenridge whose family had settled in the same district only some thirty years before the Galbreaths.
}

$p{
$elink[https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/K4YK-T8D]{Hugh Henry Breckenridge} immigrated to Pennslyvana in 1753 at age 5.
}

$blockquote{I was most courteously conducted through the district by Joe Galbreath, sixth in line from the emigrant Alexander. While there was no memory of the Breckenridges I feel sure the settlement of two families from within five miles of Campbeltown in the same area within thirty years is more than a coincidence.
}

$p{
TBD: Joe Galbreath
}


$blockquote{This Galbreath family has been more assiduous than any I know in keeping up the family connection in the States. Periodical family reunions are celebrated and a family record which has reached the ninth generation from Alexander is carefully maintained.
}

$p{
Unfortunately, since the Covid Epidemic of 2022, the meetings and reunions of the Galbreath family have stopped.
}


$p{
Nine generations were listed in "The Alexander Galbraith Family", published 1955, 1976, 1932.
}

$blockquote{
Most interesting of all is the fact that somehow a bundle of late 18th century letters from relatives at home has survived, One of these letters was published in Number 14 of the Magazine, (and repeated here- 21 july 1791), but in view of the very considerable amount of genealogical data which they contain and of the picture they give of life in Campbeltown two hundred years ago I have thought it worth while to publish them all.
}

$blockquote{
Perhaps the most distinguished member of the family who
remained in Kintyre was
$child-link[galbraith-john-1809-mcewing]{John Galbraith} (1809-1861[1881])
who was Provost of the Burgh from 1860 till 1866 and whose daughter
[ $child-link[galbraith-elizabeth-1841-fleming]{Elizabeth Galbraith} ]
married the ill-fated banker James Nicol Fleming (Magazine No. 28).
He too was descended like the emigrant [ $child-link[galbreath-alexander-1753-flemming]{Alexander} ]
from $child-link[galbreath-john-1680-mitchell]{John} in Kilteddan
and Mary Mitchell, but through their oldest son
$child-link[galbreath-archibald-1708-white]{Archibald}.
}

It appears there is confusion over on the parents of John Galbraith (1809-1881) (and his brother $child-link[galbraith-andrew-1799-scott]{Andrew}, below)

This claims he is a descendant of John Galbreath and Mary Mitchell,
via their oldest son $child-link[galbreath-archibald-1708-white]{Archibald} who married Martha White. That can't be correct since their last chld were was born in 1758.

$blockquote{
Mr A.L. Mitchell, author of that article, informs me that John's 
older brother $child-link[galbraith-andrew-1799-scott]{Andrew} (1799-1888) was Lord Provost of Glasgow, from 1857-1860. He was also a founder member of the Kintyre Club and three times its president, including during the 50th anniversary year, 1875.
}
$p{
Confirmed.
}
$blockquote{
I am particularly indebted to the late Wm. W. Galbreath Jr of Lynchburg, Virginia, a nuclear scientist, for originally making the correspondence available to me and to Mr Ralph W. Sloan of Westminster, Maryland, the present archivist of' the American Galbreaths.
}
$p{
$elink[https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/G6TS-MSR]{William Wilson Galbreath, Jr}, b. 1919 in Ohio, and died 15 Sep 1983. He is six[check] generations from Alexander Galbreath. He worked on the Manhattan Project. It's unclear what happened to the letter.
}
$p{
$elink[https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/LCB4-CPC]{Ralph W Sloan}, b. 1918, d. 2010, married to Cornelia Halie Galbreath, also a sixth generation descendant of Alexander.

}

$blockquote{
since you wrote concerning James McNairs$sup{1}
$br{}$br{}
1. James McNair was a farmer near Campbeltown. The McNairs and Galbraiths were intermarried.
}
$p{
The Galbraiths and McNairs did intermarry but no more so than other lowland families.  Some examples are:
}
$ul{
$li{$child-link[mcnair-robert-1718-galbraith]{Robert McNair}, b. 1718 married in 1744 to Janet Galbraith, of unknown origin.
}
$li{
$child-link[galbreath-samuel-1736-mcnair]{Samuel Galbreath}, b. 1736 married Janet McNair.  She was the daughter of previous family.
}
$li{
$child-link[mcnair-archibald-1722-galbraith]{Archibald McNair}, b. 1722 married Margaret Galbreath, of unknown origin.
}
$li{
$child-link[galbreath-margaret-1771-mcnair]{Nathaniel McNair}, b. 1771 married Margaret Galbreath, a six-generation decendant of James Galbreath and Mary Nielson.
}
}

$blockquote{
We had a letter from John Fleming$sup{4} from London about a month ago and he is gone for Virginia from that you may posible see him before he Returns
$br{}$br{}
4. John Fleming, a sailor, was married to Margaret Galbraith.
}
$p{
John Fleeming married $child-link[galbreath-margaret-1760-fleeming]{Margaret Galbreath} in Campbeltown on 5 Jan 1782, and had two children. However, no other records have been found.
}

$blockquote{
John Paterson$sup{5} has another son whose name is James
$br{}$br{}
5. John Paterson was married to Mary Fleming. The new baby James in 1830 took to do with the estate of his aunt Margaret Fleming, widow of David Ferguson, Smith in Campbeltown.
}
$p{
John Paterson married $child-link[fleeming-mary-1765-paterson]{Mary Fleeming} about 1785 (no marriage record has found). They had nine children the first being baptized as "John" being born on 13 Nov 1787. The Census of 1792 lists the family living at 86 Shore Street, with "John" now being "James." This child died young. There was another John bp. in 1796 and the last child born in 1807, James Paterson, went on to marry $child-link[galbraith-isabella-1808-paterson]{Isabella Galbraith}.
}
$p{ 
$child-link[ferguson-david-1748-fleeming]{David Ferguson} was born in 1749 and died in 1813. Margaret died in 1834 (not 1830), and the estate was settled by the above James Paterson ("Margaret Ferguson", 31/12/1834, Dunoon Sheriff Court, SC51/32/4).
}

$blockquote{
6. William Watson, a very prominent Merchant & Shipowner.
}
$p{
TBD
}

$blockquote{
Big Baldie$sup{9} is married to Robert Langwills daughter
$br{}$br{}
9. "Big Baldy" was Archibald Galbraith, the son of William and grandson of Archibald, the oldest brother of Alexander Galbraith's father John. His first wife Margaret Longwill died aged 20. His second wife Jean Corbet died on 2nd August 1861 aged 90. By his second wife he had ten known children.
}

$p{
$child-link[galbreath-archibald-1760-langwill-corbet]{Archibald Galbraith}, the son of $child-link[/galbreath-william-1736-dunlop]{William Galbraith} and Margaret Dunlop,  married Robert Langwill's daughter Martha in 1787. He subsequently married Jean Corbet.
}

$p{
Less certiain is the phrase "the grandson of Archibald, the oldest brother of $child-link[galbreath-alexander-1753-flemming]{Alexander Galbraith}'s father $child-link[galbreath-john-1721-langwill]{John}."  This implies Alexander descends from $child-link[galbreath-archibald-1708-white]{Archibald Galbreath} and Mary White. However there are no records for William, especially born around 1736.
}


$blockquote{
10. James Park was married to Mary Langwill. He was, in other words, a brother-in-law of Alexander Galbraith. Along with William Kerr mentioned in another letter he witnessed the Will of Margaret Fleming Ferguson on 8th December 1783. In the Duke's Census of 1792 he is shown as living in Kirk Street with his wife and children John, Mary, James and Betty. The son James died in August 1793 as mentioned in a later letter.
}

$p
Correction: "James Park was married to Mary $strike{Langwill} Galbreath" (this took a while to figure out!). $child-link[galbreath-mary-1751-park]{Mary Galbreath} was the sister of Alexander, and married James Park.

(2)The late Mr $child-link[armour-archibald-dunlop-1863-stuart-smith]{
Archibald D. Armour} in correspondence with the family in 1906 was anxious to distance himself from these ongoings. He writes: "The gossip about Andrew Armour, son to Wm. Armour farmer in Trodigal is very interresting as revealed by the baptismal records [which record] the birth to this same Andrew Armour and the daughter of Ann Armour, and her husband's name not given but the daughter's name Helen, of a son David, called a natural son, born March 7th 1792. The family of Armours in Trodigal are of the same race [as us] but we have been in the town long before the date here mentioned."
