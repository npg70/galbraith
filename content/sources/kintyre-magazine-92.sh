ARCHIBALD GALBREATH. Back to 'From Brecklate to Illinois' (No. 90), the letter written by John Ralston in 1859. He mentioned William Fleming and his business partner, Archibald Galbreath, 'that was farmer in Skerrling'. I speculated (p 17, note 11) that 'Skerrling' could be a form of Skeroblin, but opined that there was 'no record of a Galbreath/Galbraith tenant there'. By a careless oversight, I had failed to notice that a James Galbreath, tenant in Ardnacross, got the lease of 'East Skeroblingorry' in 1800.

A reader in Las Vegas, Nick Galbreath, e-mailed me on 12 June and pointed out my error, which was pleasing, because he was able to supply some background for Archibald. He was born at Skeroblin on 8 September 1803, the eldest son of James and Martha Galbreath - she shared her husband's surname - who married in 1800 and baptised eleven children between 1801 and 1821.

Archibald appears in Census 1841 as a farmer at Ugadale and in Census 1851 as a 'flesher', in which business he continued until his death in Campbeltown on 17 February 1885. He married Eugenia McCallum in Kilcalmonell in 1835 and had two children by her before her early death. In 1839, he married Margaret Loynachan in Southend and they had eight children.

Nick Galbreath states that Eugenia McCallum's baptismal name was 'Janet', but she married as 'Eugenia'. It is an exotic in Kintyre but occurred in McLean as well as McCallum families and must have originated with Eugenia Josephine Wynne, who married Robert Campbell, 10th laird of Skipness, in 1806.
