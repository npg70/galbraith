No cemetary records match.

Looking for John, whose father is Patrick, in the OPR provides three choices:

$section{
$h4{GALBREATH JOHN -- PATRICK GALBREATH/JEAN TEMPLETON -- 01/08/1731}

No marriage records, only one child, John.  Possible.
}
$section{
$h4{GALBREATH JOHN -- $child-link[galbreath-patrick-abt-1700-maxwell]{PATRICK GALBREATH/MARY MAXWELL} -- 24/02/1734}

No marriage records, two children, older daughter Mary, and younger son John.  Possible.

$section{
$h4{GALBREATH JOHN -- $child-link[galbreath-patrick-1718]{PATRICK GALBREATH/JEAN WATSON} --  13/04/1740}

There are other sons born, but this still may match if they died.
