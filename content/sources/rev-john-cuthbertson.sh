John is mentioned three times between 1751-1752, with the last being 14 Feb 1792, and then never again. Then Widow Galbreath appears in late 1753 and is mentioned multiple times until 1768.  They both appear to be 7 miles from Rev's home base of Middle Octoraro.  Also 7 miles away is Isabella and Jean Galbreath (and their families).  In 1764, one stop mentioned the Widow and both families.
