$h2{The McShannons of Kintyre: Harpers to Tacksmen}

$blockquote{
The first clearly identified musician in Kintyre was one 'Giola Criost Bruilingeach' two of whose poems are preserved in the 'Book of the Dean of Lismore' compiled circa 1513-25. From the internal evidence of the poems, both addressed to Irish patrons, Giolla Criost (fl 1458) would appear to have been a harper, for he first requests a harp in payment and in the second poem confirms its receipt. He is described as 'Bard in Leymn' which is thought to suggest that he came from Leim on the Island of Gigha and that he may have been a member of a family called MacBhreatnaich (or $b{Galbraith})...

$blockquote{
If Giolla Criost was a member of the $b{MacBhreatnaich} family, then he was probably related to a family of harpers who first come into view In the Exchequer Rentals for 1471 when they held the lands of Knockan and Clutag near Wigtown in Galloway. Three members of the family are on record between 1471-1513, first Martin, John and then Roland (or Lachlan) and although during this period they were tenants of the crown and occasionally appeared in the Treasurers accounts at court it is possible that they may have previously been associated with Whithorn under earlier Douglas patronage and that descendants remained in the area after 1513.
