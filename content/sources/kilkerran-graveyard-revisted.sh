This stone is one of three, side by side, to the members of the Clark farming family,
which descends through Robert Clark and $b{Mary Galbraith}, and Robert Clark and
Catherine McNair (married 1861), who were the parents of the tragic Mary's father,
Robert, who married Isabella Watson 4/8/1899. As the inscription records, Isabella
died on 18/6/1923, at the age of 52, and Robert on 5/3/1955 at the age of 93.
