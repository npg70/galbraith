note {
    Original record listed Hugh as Hugh Galbraith, the illegitimate child of Margaret Galbraith.
    However there is an RCE that the father was Hugh Kennedy Tailor.  And thus the childs name is
    Hugh Kennedy (or Hugh Kennedy Tailor, it's not quite clear what the surname is, although Scotlands people
    indexed it as Hugh Kennedy.)
