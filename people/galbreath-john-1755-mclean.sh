note {
    John is often listed as the son of $child-link[galbreath-john-1710-clark/]{John Galbreath} and Isobell Clark, born 1760.  However this would conflict with the census.
}

note {
    Mary's father may connected to a John McLean.  In 1768 he was in dispute of lands "Totticlach" which seems similar to the places mentioned in the baptism of her last children.$ref[totticlach]
}
note {
Mary's parents may be Archibald McLean and More Paterson. Here the birth was listed as "natural" (i.e. parents were not married).$ref[mary-parents]
