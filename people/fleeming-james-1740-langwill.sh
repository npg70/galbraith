From Kilkerran:

$blockquote{

}


$h3{What we know}

$ul{
$li{James was born about 1726, and died in 1785.}
$li{James Fleeming married Janet Langwill in 1761.}
$li{Janet was alive in 1785}
$li{Child: Agnes, Mary, Jean all match}
$li{$child-link[fleeming-jean-1778-mcmurchy]{Jean} is in the census of 1792, at age 12, living in Killowan, with John Fleeming and Jean Colville}
$li{$child-link[fleeming-john-1703-kirkland]{John Fleeming} who married Jean Kirkland is someone else.}
}

$h3{Very Likely}

$ul{
$li{Child Margaret was born around 1765, married Andrew Ralston.  Birth appears not recorded, but age is based on census and gravestones}
$li{Janet is not in the 1792 Census, implying she died before 1792}
$li{John was actually "James" and/or born in 1768-1769:
  	$ul{

$li{John Fleeming with Jean Colville is in the census of 1792. He is listed as 21, which gives a birth of 1771.  They are off two years off, so birth is probably 1769.  Jean Colvills listd as 19.
}
$li{John's burial on find-a-grave, gives a birth of 1768}
}
}
}

$h3{Still unknown}

$ul{
$li{ Child John, Isobel and Janet have missed records, or indicate birth before 1761.
