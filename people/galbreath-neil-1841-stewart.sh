    DISTRESSING BOAT ACCIDENT. On Momiay afternoon, an accident of very painful nature occurred in the Sound of Kilbrannon, off a part of the Kintyre coast known as Saddell Pluck, distant about ten miles east from Campbeltown, whereby two fishermen, named James Smith, about sixty-six years of age, and Neil Galbraith, about thirty-two years, both belonging Campbeltown, lost their lives. The deceased left Campbeltown Harbour about two o'clock in the afternoon a fishing skiff, accompanied by two fishermen, named Dugald Graham and Alexander Huie, to proceed to Carradale, where they intended fishing. About four o'clock, and while about three miles off Saddell Pluck, Huie, who was steering, attempted to put the boat about on another track, and either neglected or was unable to manage the sail properly at such a juncture, and before the boat could be brought round a squall struck her, sending the lee gunwale under water and completely submerging the boat. The men clung to her for fully an hour, up to the chin in water, but finding that they could never manage to make the shore, they agreed to cut away the halyards and free her if possible from the mast and sail and then try and right her. This was done, but the boat, as soon as freed from the mast and sail, turned right round, keel uppermost, and the men were thrown off into the water. All but Smith succeeded in scrambling upon the keel, but he was thrown too far out from the boat, and no assistance could be rendered to him. He got hold of an oar and clung to it until he became so exhausted that he could no longer keep his head above water, and cried out to the others. 44 lam going; lam going." The boat about this time turned round again, and the three men on the keel were thrown once more into the sea. Graham and Huie, after a desperate struggle, managed to get up once more on to the keel, but Galbraith was nowhere to lÂ»e seen ; the last thing he was heard to say was, "Oh rny poor wife and family!" Graham and Huie clung to the keel for four hours and a half, and were rescued by an Arran smack in charge of a man named Sillers about eight o clock in the evening. Smith's body was recovered that same night, and taken ashore to Saddell, but Galbraith's has not yet been got. Both of the deceased men were married, and each leaves a wife and family.$ref[obit]
