Perhaps the most distinguished member of the family who remained in Kintyre was John Galbraith (1809-1861) who was Provost of the Burgh from 1860 till 1866 and whose daughter married the ill-fated banker James Nicol Fleming (Magazine No. 28). He too was descended like the emigrant from John in Kilteddan and Mary Mitchell, but through their oldest son Archibald.

His Galbraith family was not native Kintyre stock, but descended from 17th century Lowland settlers. John's parents were Archibald Galbreath, merchant, and Jean Corbet. His grandfather, Archibald Galbreath, was a merchant in Campbeltown, and his great-grandfather, William, was a maltster. Each of these, like his father, married into a Plantation family: Langwill and Dunlop, respectively.

The two "Archibald Galbreath" are the same person. He married twice, first to Margaret Langwill, then to Jean Corbet. Using this correction, the grand-father is William Galbreath who married Margaret Dunlop
