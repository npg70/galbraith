name Samuel Galbreath
birth -date 'about 1765'
body {
Little is now about the origins of Samuel. Guessing his birth around 1765 would make first child born when he was 28 which seems reasonable. All children appear to have been born "in Town" and the marriage said the couple were "both of this parish".
