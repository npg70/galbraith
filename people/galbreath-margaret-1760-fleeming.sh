    With a marriage of 1782, it's likely Margaret was born between 1752 and 1762.  And from marriage stating she was "of the Parish", she might have been born in Campbeltown.  With that, there are two canidates for Margaret:
$ul{
$li{Margaret, born 1762, daughter of $child-link[galbreath-james-1713-adam]{James Galbreath} and Margaret Adam. The older brother $child-link[galbreath-david-1755-fleeming]{David} married Mary Fleeming, which may be a connection.}
$li{Margaret, born 1752, daugher of $child-link[galbreath-william-abt-1701-watson]{William Galbreath} and Margaret Watson. Little is known about this family.}
