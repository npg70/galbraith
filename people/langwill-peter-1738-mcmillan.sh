        Clearly, Jane and Archibald were not born 5 months apart. Either this was entered incorrectly (mother was not Agnes), or Jane was born earilier and just baptized later in 1772. Oddly the record doesn't say "baptized" just "born".  In general the records on this page are very different than usual one.
