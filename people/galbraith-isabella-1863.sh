body {
    Illegitimate, child of Duncan Galbraith "seaman" and Mary McDermid. The original birth record lists
    her as "Isabella McDermid", but also shows both parents.
    but there is an RCE entry more or less reconfirms the parents. Perhaps the father was written in 
    after the face.   It's unclear if the name was changed to Galbraith or what.
