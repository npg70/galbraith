note {
	Scotlands People has another record for Matthew Fleeming dated 12-Nov-1742 from the Highland 10 book.  The original document is highly damaged, but, the record for Matthew is not present, the data is probably 1740 or 1741, and not 1742.  Also the recorded baptism of 12-Nov-1742 is exactly 2 years from the other Matthew (in Vol. 11).
