$blockquote{
Henry County, Clerks Office Aug 18th 1800. I Do hereby certify that a true copy
of this will is lodged in my office.  Test. Ron Thomas.

That is Henry County, Kentucky.  Certainly his daughter Martha spent time in Henry County, and William, James, and David supposed
lived in Henry as well.  It seems John moved there or was visiting when he died.

The will is proved (witnesses confirming they saw the will signed) in Alegheny,PA a few months later on 27 Nov 1800.
