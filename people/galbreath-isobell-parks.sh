name Isobell Galbreath
gender female
external {
    familysearch LKTM-BS2
}
note {
    Often claimed to be the sister of $child-link[galbreath-alexander-1753-flemming]{Alexander Galbreath}, daughter of $child-link[/galbreath-john-1721-langwill]{John Galbreath} and Agnes Langwill, all of Campbeltown.  This is impossible since it implies Isobell got married at age 12.
}
note {
    Sometimes confused with $elink[https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/details/2DXJ-N71]{Isabella Welch} who married William Galbreath.
}
note {
    Probably has a sister Jean.  They got married on the same day, and had children baptized on the same day.
}
note {
    Strong possibility they are daughters of $elink[https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/details/K8Q2-QQK]{Robert Calbreath} and Jean Calbreath from Ayr.  Jean b. 1723, Isabell b. 1726.
}

note {
    There are other children, but not listed in Rev. Cuthbertson references.  See FamilySearch for details.
}
note {
    FamilySearch is a mess for Isobell and John Park/s.  In particular, the son Robert may be adopted from James Bratton and Isabell.  Some have made the assumption that Isabell is this Isabell Galbreath.  It's more likely they are two different people.
