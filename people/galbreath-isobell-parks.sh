note {
    Often claimed to be the sister of $child-link[galbreath-alexander-1753-flemming]{Alexander Galbreath}, daughter of $child-link[/galbreath-john-1721-langwill]{John Galbreath} and Agnes Langwill, all of Campbeltown.  This is impossible since it implies Isobell got married at age 12.  Also we know Alexander was in correspondence with his mother in Scotland, implying they did not immigrate.

note {
    Confused with $child-link[galbraith-isabel-1747-dinwiddie]{Isabel Galbraith}, b. 1847 in Bucks Co, PA, sister of a different 
    $child-link[galbraith-alexander-1749-lyle]{Alexander Galbraith}.
}
note {
    Confused with Isabella Welch, the spouse of $child-link[galbraith-william-1800-welch]{William Galbreath}
}
note {
    Possible sister $child-link[galbreath-jean-1739-wilson]{Jean Galbreath}. They got married on the same day, and had children baptized on the same day.
}
note {
    Possible they are daughters of $elink[https://www.familysearch.org/en/tree/person/details/K8Q2-QQK]{Robert Calbreath} and Jean Calbreath from Ayr.  Jean b. 1723, Isabell b. 1726.  No immigration found however, and evidence their brother John stayed in Ayr.
}

note {
    There are other children, Arthur and Francis, but not listed in the Rev. Cuthbertson diaries, and no other sources linking them.
}
note {
    FamilySearch is a mess for Isobell and John Park/s.  In particular, the son Robert may be adopted from James Bratton and Isabell.  Some have made the assumption that Isabell is this Isabell Galbreath.  It's more likely they are two different people.
