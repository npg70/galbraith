note {
    FamilySearch is a mess confusing two James.
}
note {
The link between Martha and $child-link[galbreath-samuel-1736-mcnair]{Samuel Galbreath} and Janet McNair is based on DNA and approximate age and location.
}
note {
The parents of James is sometimes listed as $child-link[galbreath-william-1736-dunlop]{William Galbreath} and Mary Dunlop.  This is unlikely as that family was listed as living in Campbeltown in 1792. After living in the city it's unlikely he'd move out to the farm.
