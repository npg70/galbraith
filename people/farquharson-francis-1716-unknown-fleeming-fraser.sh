From Kilkerran:

$blockquote{
To the memory of Daniel Farquharson, father of Francis … of Finzean, who died in September 1751, aged 66. Also of Agnes Fleming, his wife, who died on 22 October 1754, aged 26. This monument was set up by Francis Farquharson of Clachaig …
}
$p{
Implies Agnes was born in 1728, and married at age 18 in 1746.

From Economics:

$blockquote{
Farquharson:
A family who originated in Aberdeenshire. Francis,
son of Farquharson of Finzean, came to Campbeltown as
comptroller of customs and was a town councillor by November 1732. He was a member of the Lowland congregation, "Old
Farquharson, " being one of the chief opposers of the call
given by the Duke of Argyll to the Rev. John McAlpine.
(S. C. 165, ff. 106-7). He bought Clachaig estate near Tarbert.
Francis Jr. became the most prosperous merchant in the town
in the 1750’s. He married Agnes Fleming. His wide trading
interests included frequent exchanges to North America in the
1750’s. He was the first Campbeltown merchant to properly
outfit a buss for the bounty. He was Justiciary Baillie
for the herring fishing in the Western Isles and David Loch
referred to him as "a sensible, polite, well-bred man,
a man who has the interests of his country at heart. " (Loch,
Essays, II,158). He left his large estate to his sons.
Archibald, the elder, carried on the main trading interests
and lived for some time in Jamaica. James became provost of Campbeltown, 1774
}
$p{
The above has minor errors.  Donald (not Francis) was comptroller of customs, and his son was Francis (not Francis Jr).  It's unclear who James "provost of Campbeltown" is.

}
$blockquote{
The first recorded transatlantic cargo from Campbeltown went to Kingston, Jamaica, in 1745 in the Prince Charles of Belfast. William McKinlay, Campbeltown merchant and one-time provost, exported the twenty-five hundredweight soap, candles, tallow and shoes for Johnson Legg and Company of Belfast. A similar cargo followed the next year, but Francis Farquharson, another local merchant with extensive shares in herring busses, handled the exporting transactions.
