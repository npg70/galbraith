Shop broken in and things stolen.

OUTRAGE AT CAMPBELTOWN.

On Tuesday night, little after eleven o’clock, smoke was observed the shop of William Galbraith, watchmaker and jeweller, Reform Square, Campbeltown. On the door, which was found open, being pushed up, it was seen that the fire was making rapid progress. The first person to enter the shop discovered Mr. Galbraith, the proprietor, lying on floor moaning and crying out, “I'm stabbed; I’m stabbed.” Mr. Galbraith having been removed to a house near, Dr. Cunningham, who was called in, found that rather serious wound, abont three-quarters of inch deep, had been inflicted upon his left breast, a little above the heart, with several other wounds of less a serious nature. Reports regarding the cause the fire and the attack on Mr. Galbraith are very conflicting. One account says that he went home eleven o’clock usual. Finding that had left his pocket-book with some money in his shop, he, while the way back, was watched by some men, who followed him to the shop. After he had secured the pocket-book he was knocked down by a blow on the forehead and afterwards stabbed. Another account, which is more trustworthy, is that while Mr. Galbraith was going home, between ten and eleven o’clock, he observed light in his shop, and on opening the door to see the cause was a truck with a life-preserver and rendered insensible. Some time afterwards discovered that he had been stabbed in the breast and that ths premises were in flames. Mr. Galbraith is in a very precarious state. The affair has caused great sensation in Campbeltown. An empty pocket book which belonged to Mr. Galbraith, and said contained between £35 and £40, has been found in a woodyard about hundred yards from the scene of the outrage.
